# Connect 4 with AI #
AI Connect 4 using [Pygame][pygame]

[Connect 4][connect-4] is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

This version of AI Connect 4 has been developed with the [Minimax algorithm][minimax], specifically with the [Alpha-beta pruning algorithm][alphabeta].

I have developed it with comments so that everyone with a basic knowledge of Python can follow and understand the code.
No previous knowkedge of efficient algorithms is required to understand it.
